/*
! Object Oriented programming (oops)
object- oriented programming has shaped the design of many programming languages, including JavaScript

it is a set of techniques for  designing a program using objects

Abstract data types
strings, numbers, arrays these all are object classes where it exposes some properties to use

! Methods & This keyword
