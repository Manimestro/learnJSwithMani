/*
In a computer, everything is data. You can read, modify, and create data,
but nothing else exists.
All data is stored as sequences of bits, making it fundamentally similar.
13 --> 1101 (4bits)(1/2 byte)

!Data Types

!Numbers
Java script uses 32 bits to store a single number
it alocates that bits to store a number .
it varies on small, long and longer

!Special Numbers
Infinity , -Infinity , NaN are number types

!Arithmetic
Operators have precedence, determining the order in which operations are performed.
*,%,/ --> takes presendce over +,-
Parentheses can be used to explicitly define the desired order of operations.

!Strings
can be double,single, and backticks
for each char it uses --> 6bits
