In a computer, everything is data. You can read, modify, and create data,
but nothing else exists.
All data is stored as sequences of bits, making it fundamentally similar.
13 --> 1101 (4bits)(1/2 byte)

!Data Types

!Numbers
Java script uses 64 bits to store a single number
it alocates that bits to store a number .
even the number is smaller like 0 or larger like 10^10 it uses complete 64 bits
