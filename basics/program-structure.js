let,var,const --> with these we can defined binding 
let --> can be re-assigned after declaration 
var --> can be re declare (used in 2015 ecmascript)
const --> cant re-assinged after declaration

dont use keywords,reserved words for binding names

This is a group of bindings that are avaible to a programe in that context 
there are some initial bindings present in the environment (Node or browser)
like keywords, window for browser , system defaults etc

! Functions (args)
lot of  default bindings values are functions 
function is a code treated as a value 
ex: console, promt
console()--->Invoking, calling, or applying a function 
arguments --> values we pass insdie that function 
Function can make side effects(doing something out of scope of that function)
or it simply returns a value without
